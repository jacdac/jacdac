    camel: dcVoltageMeasurement
    
A service that reports a voltage measurement.

## Registers

    enum VoltageMeasurementType:u8 {
        Absolute = 0,
        Differential = 1
    }

    const measurement_type: VoltageMeasurementType @ 0x181
The type of measurement that is taking place. Absolute results are measured with respect to ground, whereas differential results are measured against another signal that is not ground.

    const measurement_name: string @ 0x182
A string containing the net name that is being measured e.g. `POWER_DUT` or a reference e.g. `DIFF_DEV1_DEV2`. These constants can be used to identify a measurement from client code.

    ro measurement: f64 V @ reading
    
The voltage measurement.

    ro measurement_error?: f64 V @ reading_error

Absolute error on the reading value.

    const min_measurement?: f64 V @ min_reading

Minimum measurable current

    const max_measurement?: f64 V @ max_reading

Maximum measurable current
